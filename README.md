# Hello! Welcome to my home assignment
This assignment includes a /get route that returns all transactions, and a /post route that accepts a csv file and saves, returns and logs its content

Before you start, make sure to:
1. Go to src/config/sequelize.ts and setup your local postgres password
2. Go to src/index and sync my model with your DB

:)
